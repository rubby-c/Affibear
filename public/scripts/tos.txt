**Payments, Refunds, Upgrading, and Downgrading**

The Afficone Service is billed in advance in accordance with our pricing schedule and all monthly and annual payments are nonrefundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial periods of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for service periods unused with an open account. At Afficone’s discretion, an exception may be made within the first 30 days of service. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties. You agree to pay for any such taxes that might be applicable to your use of the Afficone Site and payments made by you herein.

**Violation of these Terms of Service**

Afficone reserves the right to investigate and prosecute violations of any of these Terms of Service to the fullest extent of the law. Afficone may involve and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in prosecuting users who violate the Terms of Service. You acknowledge that Afficone has no obligation to prescreen or monitor your access to or use of the Afficone Site or any information, materials, or other content provided or made available through the Afficone Site, but has the right to do so. You hereby agree that Afficone may, in the exercise of Afficone sole discretion, remove or delete any entries, information, materials, or other content that violates these Terms of Service or that is otherwise objectionable.

**Cancellation**

You are solely responsible for properly canceling your Account. To do so, the account owner may send an email to contact@afficone.com with "Account Cancellation" in the subject line. Any cancellation of your Account will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in your Account. This information cannot be recovered from Afficone once your account is canceled. Please be aware that Afficone may for a time retain residual information in our backup and/or archival copies of our database. We will make reasonable commercial efforts to delete your information as soon as possible after you communicate that intention to us. Cancellations will take effect at the end of your current service period. Upon the commencement of a new service period, the Afficone Site will terminate without additional notice, and you will not be charged for any subsequent service periods. You will not be provided any refunds for unused time during your service period.

**Termination**

Afficone reserves the right to terminate any free Accounts that do not have any activity for sixty (60) days or trial accounts without a payment method thirty (30) days after expiration. Afficone, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your Account if you breach these Terms of Service. Afficone may refuse to provide you any current or future use of the Afficone Site, or any other Afficone service. Any termination of your Account will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account, denied access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in your Account. This information cannot be recovered from Afficone once your Account is terminated; however Afficone may for a time retain residual information in our backup and/or archival copies of our database.
